But the Yogi on the contrary practises Yoga with a steadfast mind and takes refuge in the Lord alone? with the mind wholly fixed on Him? on His lofty attributes such as omnipotence? omniscience? omnipresence? infinite love? beauty? grace? strength? mercy? inexhaustible wealth? ineffable splendour? pristine glory and purity.The servant of a king? though he constantly serves the king? has not got his mind fixed on him. The mind is ever fixed on his wife and children. Unlike the servant? fix your mind on Me? (the allpervading One)? and take refuge in Me alone. Practise control of the mind in accordance with the instructions given in chapter VI. Then you will know Me and My infinite attributes in full.If you sing the glory and the attributes of the Lord? you will develop love for Him and then your mind will be fixed on Him. Intense love for the Lord is real devotion. You must get full knowledge of the Self without any doubt.He who has taken refuge in the Lord? and he who is trying to fix or has fixed his mind on the Lord cannot bear the separation from the Lord even for a second.",

I am not visible to those who are deluded by the three Gunas and the pairs of opposites? and who are screened off by this universe which is a manifestation of the alities of Nature? My YogaMaya or My creative illusion. This veils the understanding of the worldlyminded people. So they are not able to behold the Lord Who keeps Maya under His perfect control.YogaMaya is the union of the three alities of Nature. The illusion or veil spread thery is called YogaMaya. The worldly people are deluded by the illusion born of the union of the three alities. Therefore? they are not able to know the Lord Who is unborn and immutable.This YogaMaya is under the perfect control of the Lord. Isvara is the wielder of Maya. Therefore it cannot obscure His own knowledge? just as the illusion created by the juggler cannot obstruct his,own knowledge or deceive him. The illusion which binds the worldly people cannot in the least affect the Lord Who has kep Maya under his perfect subjugation. (Cf.VII.13IX.5X.7XI.8)",

There is the instinct in man to preserve his body. Man wishes to attain those objects which help the preservation of the body. He wishes to get rid of those objects which give pain to the body and the mind. On account of delusion caused by the pairs of opposites? desire and aversion spring up and man cannot get the knowledge of the things as they are? even of this external universe of senseexperience and it needs no saying that in a man whose intellect is overwhelmed by desire and aversion there cannot arise the transcendental knowledge of the innermost Self.Raga (attraction) and Dvesha (repulsion)? pleasure and pain? heat and cold? happiness and misery? joy and sorrow? success and failure? censure and priase? honour and dishonour are the Dvandvas or the pairs of opposites. Desire and aversion (or attraction and repulsion) induce delusion in all beings and serve as obstacles to the dawn of the knowledge of the Self.He whose intellect is obscured by the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites is not able to realise I am the Self. Therefore he does not adore Me as the Self.He who is a victim of RagaDvesha loses the power of discrimination. He wishes that pleasant objects should last for ever and that disagreeable or unpleasant objects should disappear immediately. How could this be Objects that are conditioned in time? space and causation will perish. That which is agreeable and pleasant now will become disagreeable and unpleasant after some time. The mind is ever fluctuating. It demands variety and gets disgusted with monotony.",

The mind becomes serene and calm. The little selfarrogating personality slowly dies. You grow in spirituality. The divine flame becomes brighter and brighter. You become impersonal.Sin To forget ones identity with the Supreme Soul is the greatest sin. To see difference is sin. To take the body as the Self? to believe that this world is real is sin. Selfishness is sin. Egoism is sin. Ignorance is sin.Steadfast in vows The man steadfast in vows entertains a firm resolve I must realise the Self now I will not budge an inch from my seat till I attain Selfrealisation. He has the firm conviction that Brahman is the only Reality. This world is unreal. It is like a mirage. I can attain immortality and eternal bliss if I realise the Self only. There is not an iota of happiness in the sensual objects. Therefore the Lord says? Those persons of pure deeds worship Me steadfast in vows.",
